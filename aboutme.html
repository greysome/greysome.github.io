Welcome to my little space!
<br><br>

I am Way Yan, an undergraduate student at the National University of
Singapore. I really like computers &mdash; in particular, peering into
their inner workings, studying the history of CS, and just building my
silly little programs. I've also set a personal goal of working
through the exercises in <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> (my
written-up solutions can be
found <a href="https://github.com/greysome/project-taco/tree/main/taocp">here</a>).
<br><br>

Beyond academics, I have a deep affinity for chiptune music. It is a
surprisingly flexible and expressive medium, and one can bring up
intriguing technical matters like the emulation of sound chips.

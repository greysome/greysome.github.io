Welcome to my little space!
<br><br>
I am Way Yan, an undergraduate student at the National University of
Singapore. I like math and computers &mdash; both its practical and
theoretical aspects. I've set a personal goal of working through the
exercises in <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>.
<br><br>
Beyond academics, I have a deep affinity for chiptune music. It is a
surprisingly flexible and expressive medium, and one can bring up
intriguing technical matters like the emulation of sound chips.

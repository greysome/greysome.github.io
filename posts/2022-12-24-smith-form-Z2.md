# Visualising Smith normal form on $\Z^2$


Let $M$ be a $2\times2$ integer matrix. Its columns $v,w$ span a
sublattice $L=\span\\{v,w\\}\subseteq\Z^2$. Smith normal form tells us there
exists invertible matrices $P$ and $Q$ such that

$$PMQ = \begin{pmatrix}d_1& \\ &d_2\end{pmatrix},\quad\text{where $d_1\mid d_2.$}$$

I intend to give a geometric interpretation in terms of lattices, by
observing how $L$ changes when $M$ is multiplied by an invertible
matrix to the left or right.

If $A$ is invertible then it is a product of elementary matrices. So
WLOG we can assume $A$ is elementary. If $M$ is multiplied by $A$ to
the right, then $A$ acts on the columns of $M$. There are three types
of column operations:

1. Swapping the columns

2. Scaling a column by a unit factor, namely $-1$. This is reflection
about the origin.

3. Adding one column by a scalar multiple of another.

Note that all of these operations leave $L$ unchanged, since

$$\span\{v,w\} = \span\{w,v\} = \span\{-v,w\} = \span\{v+cw,w\}.$$

Thus multiplication to the right essentially doesn't matter. What
about multiplication to the left? This time the rows of $M$ are acted
upon, and there are three actions:

1. Swapping the rows. This essentially swaps the $x$ and $y$ coords
of the columns, thus reflecting them about the line $y=x$.

2. Multiplying a row by the unit factor $-1$. This means reflection of
both columns by either the $x$- or the $y$-axis.

3. Adding one row by a scalar multiple of another. This corresponds to
a shearing operation on both columns.

Thus the action of left multiplication on $L$ is simply a linear
transformation. Smith normal form claims that any sublattice can be
transformed via the three aforementioned operations into a 'simple'
sublattice generated by the columns $(d_1,0)$ and $(0,d_2)$. Here's
the process demonstrated with a simple example.

**Exercise:** Try this out with the matrix
  $({2\atop0}{0\atop3})$. (The Smith normal form is
  $({1\atop0}{0\atop6})$.)

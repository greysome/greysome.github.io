    <h1 id="why-quaternion-multiplication-resembles-the-cross-product">Why quaternion multiplication resembles the cross product</h1>
<p>Recall the rules of quaternion multiplication are given by</p>
<p>$$\begin{matrix}
ij=k, &amp; ik=-j, &amp; jk=i \\
ji=-k, &amp; ki=j, &amp; kj=-i.
\end{matrix}$$</p>
<p>If $i,j,k$ are interpreted as the standard basis vectors in $\R^3$,
then multiplication corresponds precisely to the cross product! I've
always wondered why, and I finally managed to find a satisfactory
explanation.</p>
<p>I was directly inspired by wy.22/6/2021 where I derived
$\Aut(Q_8)$. In particular I had the idea of interpreting the product
$ijk$ as the $3\times3$ matrix $I=(i\ j\ k)$, and interpreting the
equality $ijk=-1$ as saying that $I$ has positive orientation. (It is
weird that $-1$ should correspond to positive orientation, but it
doesn't lead to any major problems.)</p>
<p>In general, if $a,b,c$ is a permutation of $i,j,k$ then the sign of
the product $abc$ is equal to (the opposite of) the orientation of the
matrix $(a\ b\ c)$. This is because every permutation can be
decomposed into transpositions, and transpositions flip both the sign
of the product $abc$ and the orientation of $(a\ b\ c)$. For instance,
$ij=-ji$ so $jik=1$, and indeed $(j\ i\ k)$ has negative
orientation. Therefore, for $abc=-1$ to be true, we must have
$c=a\times b$, so that by the property of cross product $(a\ b\ c)$
has positive orientation.</p>
<p>This argument easily generalises if we allow $a,b,c$ to be signed,
i.e. take values in $\{\pm i,\pm j,\pm k\}$.</p>

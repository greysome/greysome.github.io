    <h1 id="casus-irreducibilis-for-cubic-polynomials">Casus irreducibilis for cubic polynomials</h1>
<p>Cardano's formulas gives us the roots of a cubic in terms of
radicals. For a depressed cubic $x^3+px+q$, these roots are</p>
<p>$$\begin{equation}
\label{equation:cubic-roots}
r_1 = {z_1+z_2\over 3},\quad
r_2 = {\omega^2 z_1 + \omega z_2 \over 3},\quad
r_3 = {\omega z_1 + \omega^2 z_2 \over 3},
\end{equation}$$</p>
<p>where $\omega$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity, $d=-4p^3-27q^2$ is
the discriminant and</p>
<p>$$z_1 = \sqrt[3]{-27q+3\sqrt{-3d} \over 2},\quad
z_2 = \sqrt[3]{-27q-3\sqrt{-3d} \over 2}.$$</p>
<p>As \eqref{equation:cubic-roots} shows, the solution takes a detour to
the complex numbers, even when all the roots are real. I'll show that
when the cubic is irreducible (<em>casus irreducibilis</em>) and has real
roots, this phenomenon is unavoidable (see the below Theorem). Thus
one cannot hope to find some alternative expression for the roots that
avoids complex numbers.</p>
<p>Let $F$ be a subfield of $\R$ and $f(x)\in F[x]$ be an irreducible
cubic with real roots. The degree of the splitting field $E\subset\R$
is at least 3, so $G_f=A_3$ or $S_3$. Note also that if $d$ is the
discriminant, then $\sqrt d\in E$ is real, and so $d&gt;0$, which implies
$G_f=A_3$.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If $r$ is real and $r^p\in F$ for $p$ a prime, then $F(r)$
does not contain a splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$. Furthermore,
$f(x)$ remains irreducible over $F(r)$.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> I proved in <a href="2023-01-25-galoisgrp-xp-a.html">this other
entry</a> that $x^p-r^p$ is either
irreducible or has a root in $F$. Thus $[F(r):F]=1$ or $p$.  Supposing
that $F(r)$ contains a splitting field $E$, we can eliminate the first
possibility and by degree considerations also conclude that $p=3$, so
that $F(r)=E$. But this means $F(r)/F$ is normal, so it contains the
conjugates $\omega r$, $\omega^2r$, where $\omega$ is a primitive 3rd
root of unity. So $F(r)\not\subset\R$, implying $r$ is not
real. Lastly, $f(x)$ must be irreducible over $F(r)$, otherwise $F(r)$
contains $F(r_1)$ for some root $r_1$, which is a splitting field
since $[F(r_1):F]=3$. $\qed$</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There exists no subfield $K$ of $\R$ that has a root
tower of $F$ and contains a splitting field of $f(x)$ over $F$.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> Fix a root tower and suppose $L\subset L(\sqrt[n]{a})$ are
successive elements, where $a\in L$. We can factor the extension
$L(\sqrt[n]{a})/L$ into a tower of subextensions with prime
indices. For example if $n=pq$ with $p,q$ prime then we have the tower</p>
<p>$$L\subset L(\sqrt[p]{a}) \subset L(\sqrt[p]{a},\sqrt[pq]{a}) =
L(\sqrt[n]{a}).$$</p>
<p>Since $K\subset\R$, all the radicals are real. So if $L$ does not
contain a splitting field of $f(x)$ and $f(x)$ is irreducible over
$L$, then we can repeatedly apply the lemma to conclude that
$L(\sqrt[n]{a})$ does not contain a splitting field either and $f(x)$
remains irreducible over $L(\sqrt[n]{a})$. By working our way up the
root tower starting from $F$, we can conclude that $K$ does not
contain a splitting field. $\qed$</p>

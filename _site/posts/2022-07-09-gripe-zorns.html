    <h1 id="a-small-gripe-on-zorn-s-lemma">A small gripe on Zorn's lemma</h1>
<p>Recall the usual proof that commutative rings have maximal ideals:
every chain of ideals has an upper bound (their union), and apply
Zorn's. However, I always found this unsatisfying because there
doesn't seem to be a relationship between the maximal ideal's
existence and the union construction; it feels somewhat indirect. I
find it cleaner to identify a maximal chain of ideals and directly
construct the maximal ideal as the union. The claim that every poset
has a maximal chain<sup><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> is called the <em>Hausdorff Maximality Principle</em>
and fortunately it is almost trivially equal to Zorn's.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>HMP $\imp$ Zorn's<br />
Suppose every chain has an upper bound. By hypothesis there is a
maximal chain, and its upper bound is a maximal element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zorn's $\imp$ HMP<br />
Consider the poset $P$ of chains under the subset relation. Every
chain in $P$ has an upper bound, which is its union; thus by Zorn's
there is a maximal element in $P$ which is a maximal chain.</p>
</li>
</ol>

    <a href="/index.html">&lt; Back</a> 

    <h1 id="project-taco-update-2">Project Taco update 2</h1>
<p>Six months have passed since my last
<a href="./2025-01-03-taco-1.html">update</a>, but I've finally worked through
Chapter 2; thus concludes Volume 1. I was very serious about this
reading project: almost every day, I would spend at least an hour
working through exercises, eventually getting more than 80% done
(meaning I solved it on my own or understood Knuth's
solution). Needless to say, it was a greatly enlightening and
enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Knuth introduces the fundamental data structures of
arrays, stacks, queues, deques and trees, then he discusses memory
management methods such as garbage collection and dynamic allocation
(malloc). The latter half was relevant back when the volume was
written in 1968 — memory was scarce and there was no operating
system to delegate the dirty work of managing memory.</p>
<p>Nowadays these topics are covered in other texts, but I am very fond
of Knuth's treatment. Firstly, he is deeply involved with low-level
implementation details — a reflection of that era in which programs
were written in machine language. For example, he would give the
sequence of MIX instructions for inserting a node into a linked list
from a pool of available memory. Such discussion may seem outdated to
a modern eye, but personally I greatly appreciated it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I learned to see the computer as a giant canvas of memory in which
we can structure data as we see fit to solve the problem at
hand. Adopting this point of view makes programming a fun and
empowering activity.</p>
<p>Quoting Knuth from <em>Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms</em>:
"Something magically beautiful happens when a sequence of commands and
decisions is able to marshal a collection of data into organized
patterns or to discover hidden structure."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A data structure can be implemented in different ways. A queue can
be represented as an array with front and rear pointers, but it also
can be represented as a linked list (Program 2.2.3T). Or, there are
multiple ways of storing a List node (2.3.5), with subtle
differences when performing algorithms over the List. Being flexible
with implementation details is a part of programming technique.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, each section is accompanied by a nontrivial program
demonstrating the data structure. The most impressive one is surely
his elevator simulation program, where a doubly linked circular queue
stores the sequence of events to be processed as time
progresses. These example programs are not only interesting in their
own right, they also show how seemingly complex programs can be broken
down into relatilvely simple principles of operation. I think this
instils courage in me to tackle large projects.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the exercises are top-notch. Sometimes Knuth shares some
super cool fact (did you know a binary tree can be traversed <em>without</em>
using a stack?); sometimes he gives you an opportunity to hone your
programming technique (write this program in MIX... and then analyse
its runtime). I found his solutions are well worth reading even if I
could solve them confidently: he might use a better method, or he
might supply remarks providing insight/motivation/history, or he might
go on a page-long tangent to solve a much more general version of the
exercise. All in all, I cannot claim to have learned much from TAOCP if
I did not work through the exercises meticulously.</p>
<br>
<p>So I've given my 3 big reasons for liking TAOCP. But I also want to give
a shoutout to the mathematical sections because they have such
interesting material:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2.3.4.1 for its direct application to <a href="https://github.com/greysome/project-taco/blob/main/mmmmmix/analyzeprogram.c">program
analysis</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.3.4.2 for the method of constructing Eulerian trails;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.3.4.3 for the mindblowing fact that a plane can be tiled with
tetrads if its upper right quadrant can;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.3.4.4 for the masterful manipulation of generating functions and
the shocking correspondences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I tracked my progress systematically using a spreadsheet. Every single
exercise was given a row, and it would be marked NOT DONE or DONE. As
more and more got marked DONE, I could clearly see the progress I was
making, and this was an important source of motivation. Occasionally I
would skip an exercise so that I would not get stuck at one place and
burn out.</p>
<p>
<table style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <img src="/resource/taocp-spreadsheet.jpg"
           alt="TAOCP spreadsheet"
           style="width: 60%; height: auto"
           class="img-responsive" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><p>Figure 1. A small snippet of the spreadsheet</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<br>
<p>Moving on, I plan to read Chapter 3 which is about random numbers. I
expect progress to be slower because it is math-heavy and math
exercises take longer to solve based on experience; furthermore I have
more university commitments.</p>

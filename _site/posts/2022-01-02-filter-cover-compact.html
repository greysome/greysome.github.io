    <h1 id="equivalence-of-filter-and-cover-compactness">Equivalence of filter and cover compactness</h1>
<p>A space $X$ is <em>filter compact</em> iff every nonempty filter has at least
one cluster point. I'll show that this is equivalent to the usual
definition of compactness which I'll cover <em>cover
compactness</em>. Annoyingly I couldn't find any proof online so I had to
come up with the following proof myself.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> $X$ is filter compact $\iff$ $X$ is cover compact.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> ($\impd$): Suppose $X$ is not filter compact. That means
there is a nonempty filter $F$ such that every $x\in X$ has a nbhd
$U_x$ which is disjoint from some $S_x\in F$. The $U_x$'s form an open
cover of $X$ and assuming cover compactness, there is a subcover
$\\{U_i\\}_{i\in I}$ indexed by the finite set $I$. Then, the finite
intersection</p>
<p>$$\bigcap_{i\in I} S_i$$</p>
<p>is nonempty since $F$ is nonempty. But at the same time, this
intersection is disjoint from all $U_i$'s, contradicting the claim
that $\\{U_i\\}_{i\in I}$ covers $X$.</p>
<p>($\imp$): Suppose $X$ is not cover compact. So there is an open cover
$\\{U_i\\}_{i\in I}$ with no finite subcover. To give an overview, I
construct an increasing ordinal-indexed sequence of opens whose union
is $X$, and then consider the filter generated by the complements.</p>
<p>By well-ordering the index set $I$, we can assume it is some ordinal
$\gamma$. Then, for all $\beta\le\gamma$, define</p>
<p>$$V_\beta := \bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\beta} U_\alpha.$$</p>
<p>Each $V_\beta$ is open in $X$, and they form an increasing sequence.</p>
<p>Now, let $\kappa$ be the least ordinal such that $V_\kappa=X$. I want $\kappa$ to satisfy two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\kappa$ is a limit ordinal</li>
<li>$\kappa\ge\omega$.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second condition is automatically satisfied because $\{U_i\}$ has
no finite subcover. The first condition may not be true in general:
for instance, if $X=(0,1]$ and the open cover consists of intervals
$(1/n,3/4)$ and $(1/2,1]$, then one might have the sequence</p>
<p>$$\begin{matrix}
\beta &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega &amp; \omega+1 \\
V_\beta &amp; (1/2,\,3/4) &amp; (1/3,\,3/4) &amp; (1/4,\,3/4) &amp; \ldots &amp; (0,\,3/4) &amp; (0,\,1],
\end{matrix}$$</p>
<p>where $\kappa=\omega+1$. Luckily, we can circumvent this issue: write
$\kappa=\kappa'+n$ where $\kappa'$ is a limit ordinal and $n$ is
finite, then form a new increasing sequence of opens by moving the
last $n$ opens to the front:</p>
<p>$$V'_\beta := \left(\bigcup_{\kappa'&lt;\alpha\le\kappa} U_\alpha\right)
\cup \left(\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\beta} V_\alpha\right).$$</p>
<p>It can be seen that $\kappa'$ is the least ordinal satisfying
$V'_{\kappa'}=X$. For instance, the sequence above is transformed into</p>
<p>$$\begin{matrix}
\beta &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \ldots &amp; \omega \\
V_\beta &amp; (1/2,\,1] &amp; (1/3,\,1] &amp; (1/4,\,1] &amp; \ldots &amp; (0,\,1].
\end{matrix}$$</p>
<p>Let $\{V_\beta\}$ be our increasing sequence of opens whose
corresponding ordinal $\kappa$ satisfies the two conditions
above. Now, define $F$ to be the filter generated by the complements
$V_\beta^c$ where $\beta&lt;\kappa$. Note that the complements form a
nested decreasing sequence and none of them are empty by definition of
$\kappa$, so they satisfy the finite intersection property and thus
$F$ is nonempty.</p>
<p>Lastly, we show that $F$ has no cluster point. We have</p>
<p>$$X = V_\kappa = \bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa} V_\alpha,$$</p>
<p>where the second equality holds because $\kappa$ is a limit ordinal. For instance, if $\kappa=\omega+1$ then</p>
<p>$$\begin{align*}
V_\kappa &amp;= \left(\bigcup_{n\in\N} U_n\right) \cup U_\omega, \quad\text{whereas} \\
\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa} V_\alpha &amp;= \bigcup_{n\in\N} U_n.
\end{align*}$$</p>
<p>Therefore every $x\in X$ is contained in some $V_\alpha$ where
$\alpha&lt;\kappa$, so $x$ is disjoint from $V_\alpha^c\in F$. But
$V_\alpha^c$ is closed so some nbhd of $x$ is also disjoint from
$V_\alpha^c$, therefore $x$ is not a cluster point of $F$. $\qed$</p>

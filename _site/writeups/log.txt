Given a sequence an, we can form the sequence of averages

b1=a1, b2=(a1+a2)/2, b3=(a1+a2+a3)/3, ...

The limit of bn's is called the Cesaro limit, and it exists if the
limit of an's exists.

Proof. Let the limit be l. Choose a large N such that

|an-l| < e/2    for   n>N.

We seek to bound the difference

|bn-l| <= 1/n sum(1in) |ai-l|.

To do so, we can choose M>N so large that

sum(1iN) |ai-l| < Me/2,

and then observe that for n>M,

1/n sum(1in) |ai-l|.
= 1/n [ sum(1iN) |ai-l| + sum(N+1 i n) |ai-l| ]
= 1/n [ sum(1iN) |ai-l| + (n-N)e/2 ]
< 1/n [ Me/2 + (n-N)e/2 ]
= 1/n [ ne/2 + ne/2 ]
= e.

Put in words, N is chosen to make the tail sum small, and M is chosen
to make the initial sum small. QED

On 7/2, I was introduced to a wonderful solution involving Cesaro
limits. Notice how it sidesteps any manual epsilon-delta reasoning.

Problem (NUS, MA2108S problem set, AY2024-2025 Sem 2).

Let a1>0 and a(n+1) = an + 1/an. Determine whether an/sqrt(n) is
convergent. If it is convergent, find the limit.


Solution.

We can directly evaluate an^2/n. Expanding out,

an^2/n
= 1/n [ 2 + 1/a(n-1)^2 + a(n-1)^2 ]
= 1/n [ 4 + 1/a(n-1)^2 + 1/a(n-2)^2 + a(n-2)^2 ]
= ...
= 2(n-1)/n + 1/n sum(1in)1/ai^2 + a1^2/n.

Using the trivial bound an^2 >= 2(n-1), we have 1/an^2 -> 0 and thus
the middle term (a Cesaro limit) vanishes. Therefore, an^2/n -> 2.

The rth Fourier coefficient (r in Z) of a function f is defined as

fhat(r) = 1/2pi int(-pi t pi) f(t)e^(-irt) dt.

We can usually re-express f as an infinite sum of exponentials
weighted by Fourier coefficients, i.e.

lim(n->infty) sum(-n r n) fhat(r) e^(irt) -> f(t).

The obvious approach to show this is to expand out fhat(r) and
simplify, obtaining

1/2pi sum(-n r n) [ int(-pi s pi) f(s)e^(-irs) ds ] * e^(irt)
= 1/2pi int(-pi s pi) [ f(s) sum(-n r n) e^(ir(t-s)) ] ds
= 1/2pi int(-pi s pi) [ f(s) Dn(t-s) ] ds
= 1/2pi int(-pi s pi) [ f(t-s) Dn(s) ] ds  (substitute s->t-s)  (*),

where Dn(s) = sum(-n r n) e^(irs) is the *Dirichlet kernel*.
Elementary manipulations show that it is equal to

sin((n+1)s/2) / sin(s/2),

and the convergence of (*) to f(t) depends crucially on whether the
"mass" of Dn(s) is sufficiently concentrated around s=0 for large
n. The concomitant analysis of Dn(s) requires the imposition of
further conditions on f, such as "bounded variation", "Holder
conditions", and so on -- it is not a particularly elegant theory.

A much easier approach is taking the Cesaro limit of exponentials:

lim(n->infty) sum(-n r n) (n+1-|r|)/(n+1) fhat(r) e^(irt)
                          ^ extra weighting coefficient

If we expand out fhat(r) as in above, we get

1/2pi int(-pi s pi) [ f(t-s) Fn(s) ] ds,

where

Fn(s)
= sum(-n r n) (n+1-|r|)/(n+1) e^(irs)  (a standard double sum)
= 1/(n+1) [ sin((n+1)s/2) / sin(s/2) ] ^ 2

is the *Fejer kernel*. This is more well-behaved than Dn(s): it
uniformly converges to 0 on [-d,d] for all d>0. Thus it is much easier
to prove that the "mass" concentrates around s=0, and we only require
that f be continuous. A huge win for Cesaro.

f is generally taken to be a periodic function from [-pi,pi] to C. The
subset of real-valued f corresponds to the sequence of Fourier
coefficients ar such that a(-r) = conj(ar) (r>0).

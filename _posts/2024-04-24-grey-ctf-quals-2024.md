### Filter ciphertext (crypto)

*I rolled my own crypto. What could go wrong?* [(code)](/resource/filter_ciphertext.py)

Before breaking the program, I try to understand how it works exactly. After all, being good at crypto requires the ability to comprehend [man-made horrors](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/196).

The `encrypt()` function works by breaking the plaintext `pt` into blocks $B_0\ B_1\ \cdots\ B_n$ of 16 bytes, and computing the ciphered blocks

$$\begin{align}\label{eq:1}
\begin{split}
C_0 &= f(B_0\oplus\text{iv}), \\
C_1 &= f(B_1\oplus B_0\oplus C_0), \\
C_2 &= f(B_2\oplus B_1\oplus C_1), \\
&\;\;\vdots
\end{split}
\end{align}$$

Here $f$ refers to AES encryption of a single block. I usually require pictures to comprehend things, so I turned the equations into a diagram:

On the other hand, `decrypt()` recovers the plaintext from the ciphertext `ct` $= C_0\ C_1\ \cdots\ C_n$:

$$\begin{align}\label{eq:2}
\begin{split}
B_0 &= f\inv(C_0)\oplus\text{iv}, \\
B_1 &= f\inv(C_1)\oplus B_0\oplus C_0, \\
B_2 &= f\inv(C_2)\oplus B_1\oplus C_1, \\
&\;\;\vdots
\end{split}
\end{align}$$

alt="decryption diagram"
figno=2

However, before the decryption there is code to filter out the blocks $C_i$ of the encrypted secret:

<pre><code class="python">def decrypt(ct):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [ct[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(ct), BLOCK_SIZE)]

    for block in blocks:
	if block in secret_enc:
	    blocks.remove(block)

    [actual decryption code]</code></pre>

The author's intention is probably that we shouldn't obtain the secret by... running the encrypted secret through the decrypt function. To hammer home the point, the author even specifically disallows the entire encrypted secret as input:

<pre><code class="python">res = input("> ")

try:
    enc = bytes.fromhex(res)

    if (enc == secret_enc):
	print("Nice try.")
	continue

    ...

except Exception as e:
    print(e)</code></pre>

Nevertheless, a Python programmer would know this is bad code, because it is modifying the list `blocks` while iterating through it.

To illustrate why, let's iterate through an example list <code>[<b>a</b>,b,<b>c</b>,d]</code>, where the bold elements are to be removed. In the first iteration, the current element is at the one at index 0, namely `a`. It is removed and we proceed to the next iteration. Now the current element is the one at index 1. But because the list is now <code>[b,<b>c</b>,d]</code>, the current element is `c`, meaning we skipped over `b`! Nevertheless we carry on by removing `c` and proceeding to the next iteration. Now the current element is the one at index 2. But the list now has only two elements `[b,d]`, and Python silently exits the loop. Notice how `b` and `d` were never iterated through.

We can exploit this bug to our advantage. If $A\ B\ C\ \cdots$ are the blocks of the encrypted secret and we input $A\ A\ B\ B\ C\ C\ \cdots$, then the loop will run in such a way that afterwards `blocks` is `[A,B,C,...]`. Then the output will be the original secret!

Wow! Here's the flag: grey{00ps_n3v3r_m0d1fy_wh1l3_1t3r4t1ng}</code></pre>

As a small addendum, here's how I would patch the `decrypt()` function:

<pre><code class="python">def decrypt(ct):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [ct[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(ct), BLOCK_SIZE)]
    
    tmp = iv
    ret = b""
    
    for block in blocks:
        if block in secret_enc:
	    continue
        res = xor(cipher.decrypt(block), tmp)
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)
    
    return ret</code></pre>

### Filter plaintext (crypto)

*Maybe this will work?* [(code)](/resource/filter_plaintext.py)

As a sequel to the previous challenge, this is more involved. There are two ciphers $C$ and $C^+$. $C$ is the custom one used previously, except for a small change in the `decrypt()` functionality. $C^+$ is a normal AES-CBC cipher used to encrypt the flag. We have the ciphertext and iv for $C^+$, and its key is the md5 hash of the plaintext secret. Thus the challenge boils down to decrypting the encrypted secret, with which decrypting $C^+$ is trivial.

The `decrypt()` function is similar to before, except there is no more buggy loop and it filters out any plaintext block appearing in the secret from the return value. Thus the strategy of spitting the encrypted secret $C_0\ C_1\ \cdots\,$ back at the program doesn't work.

My next strategy is to input something of the form $K\ C_0\ C_1\ C_2\ \cdots$, where $K$ is some block. The idea is to pretend the decryption still starts at $C_0$, except through $K$ we have some control over the 'iv' (which is actually $K\oplus f\inv(K)\oplus\text{original iv}$).

To me the most natural value for $K$ is the zero block $\bf0 = 00\ldots00$, because XORing with a zero block does nothing. Then the 'iv' is $D\oplus\text{iv}$ where $D=f\inv(\bf0)$, and using \eqref{eq:1} the decrypted blocks are

$$\begin{align}
\begin{split}
&f\inv(C_0)\oplus D\oplus\text{iv} = B_0\oplus D, \\
&f\inv(C_1)\oplus C_0\oplus (B_0\oplus D) = B_1\oplus D, \\
&f\inv(C_2)\oplus C_1\oplus (B_1\oplus D) = B_2\oplus D, \\
&\qquad\qquad\qquad\vdots
\end{split}
\end{align}$$

Luckily, these blocks won't be filtered out of the result of `decrypt()`. So it remains to find $D$, which is equivalent to finding the iv since we know the 'fake iv' $D\oplus\text{iv}$ (it is the first block of the output). I had to play around a bit before figuring out how: we enter the input $\bf0\ \bf0$. Then the equations show that

$$\begin{align*}
\bf0 \quad&\text{decrypts to}\quad D\oplus\text{iv}, \\
\bf0 \quad&\text{decrypts to}\quad D\oplus [\bf0\oplus (D\oplus\text{iv})] = \text{iv}
\end{align*}$$

Putting all of these steps together:
